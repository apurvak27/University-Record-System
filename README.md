# University-Record-System - Problem Description 

University of Knowledge (UoK) is a small university. Given its recurrent lower budgets,
UoK could not afford a big and integrated system such as an Enterprise Resource Planner (ERP). Rather, UoK has
been developing several independent systems to reduce paperwork. A group of students decided they could help. They
propose to use their coursework to gradually create such a system.
As a proof of concept, the university need a system able to load module descriptors and students. Then, they need
to create modules and register students to the modules. Ultimately, the university wants to generate reports about
students and their module performance.
